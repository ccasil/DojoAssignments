Assignment: Making and Reading from Dictionaries
Create a dictionary containing some information about yourself. The keys should include name, age, country of birth, favorite language.

There are two steps to this process, building a dictionary and then gathering all the data from it. Write a function that can take in and print out any dictionary keys and values.

Note: The majority of data we will manipulate as web developers will be hashed in a dictionary using key-value pairs. Repeat this assignment a few times to really get the hang of unpacking dictionaries, as it's a very common requirement of any web application.
