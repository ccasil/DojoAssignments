Assignment: Fun with Functions
Create a series of functions based on the below descriptions.

Odd/Even:
Create a function called odd_even that counts from 1 to 2000. As your loop executes have your program print the number of that iteration and specify whether it's an odd or even number.

Multiply:
Create a function called 'multiply' that iterates through each value in a list (e.g. a = [2, 4, 10, 16]) and returns a list where each value has been multiplied by 5.

Hacker Challenge:
Write a function that takes the multiply function call as an argument. Your new function should return the multiplied list as a two-dimensional list. Each internal list should contain the 1's times the number in the original list.
