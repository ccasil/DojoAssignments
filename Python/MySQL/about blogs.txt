Assignment: Blogs
Create the ERD for a platform that allows users to create blogs, similar to blogspot.com.

The platform must allow users to register, create multiple blogs, and even allow the user to invite other users to be co-administrators of the blog. The administrators of the blog can change the blog name, add posts, edit posts, add comments, edit comments for each post, and upload new files associated with the blog post. We also want to capture information about which page the logged in users are viewing (e.g. page visited, when they visited, how long they stayed, IP address, name, etc). 

Use the MySQL workbench to complete this assignment.
