Assignment: Books
Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks users, books, and user's favorite books.

Each book should have a title and an author, and each user should be able to save a list of their favorite books. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this database. For the purposes of this assignment, you may include the author's name directly into the book records, even though it would be better normalized by creating a separate author's table.
