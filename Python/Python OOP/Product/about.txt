• Brand

• Status: default "for sale"

Methods:

• Sell: changes status to "sold"

• Add tax: takes tax as a decimal amount as a parameter and returns the price of the item including sales tax

• Return: takes reason for return as a parameter and changes status accordingly. If the item is being returned because it is defective, change status to "defective" and change price to 0. If it is being returned in the box, like new, mark it "for sale". If the box has been, opened, set the status to "used" and apply a 20% discount.

Every method that doesn't have to return something should return self so methods can be chained.
