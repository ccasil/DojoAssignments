Assignment: MathDojo
HINT: To do this exercise, you will probably have to use 'return self'. If the method returns itself (an instance of itself), we can chain methods.

PART I
Create a Python class called MathDojo that has the methods add and subtract. Have these 2 functions take at least 1 parameter.

Then create a new instance called md. It should be able to do the following task:

md.add(2).add(2,5).subtract(3,2).result
which should perform 0+2+(2+5)-(3+2) and return 4.

PART II
Modify MathDojo to take at least one integer(s) and/or list(s) as a parameter with any number of values passed into the list. It should now be able to perform the following tasks:

md.add([1], 3,4).add([3,5,7,8], [2,4.3,1.25]).subtract(2, [2,3], [1.1,2.3]).result
should do 0+1+3+4+(3+5+7+8)+(2+4.3+1.25)-2-(2+3)-(1.1+2.3) and return its result.

PART III
Make any needed changes in MathDojo in order to support tuples of values in addition to lists and singletons.
