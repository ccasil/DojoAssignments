Assignment: The Wall
Create a wall/forum page where users will be able to post a message and see the message displayed by other users. Store the messages in a table called 'messages' and retrieve the messages from the database. Follow the below wireframe.

1. Create a login and registration page that is displayed when a user navigates to 'localhost:5000/'

2. Once the user has logged in successfully redirect them to 'localhost:5000/wall' that will show the wall.

Once you get the messages to show up, allow users to post comments for any message. Store the replies/comments to the message in a separate table called 'comments'.

Extra Credit I (optional) 
Allow the user to delete his/her own messages.

Extra Credit II (optional)
Allow the user to delete his/her own message but only if the message was made in the last 30 minutes.
