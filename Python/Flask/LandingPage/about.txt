Assignment: Landing Page
Create a flask project capable of handling the following routes.

localhost:5000/    
This route should serve a view file called index.html and display a greeting. This will be considered our 'root route'.

localhost:5000/ninjas    
This route should serve a view file called ninjas.html and display information about ninjas.

localhost:5000/dojos/new    
This route should serve a view file called dojos.html and have a form. Don't worry where the form should be sent to for now, you can simply set your action blank, like this:action=''.

Next Steps
Create a folder inside of your project labeled static. This static folder will be used to serve all of our static content, such as stylesheets, images, and javascript files! Now place a stylesheet in the static folder and reference it in our view files (templates).
