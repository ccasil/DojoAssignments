Assignment: Portfolio
Build a server document that can handle 3 different route requests.

Root
Root will always be the first page your user will see. If you remember, root is located at "/". This simply means that when a user sends a request to your website's url, without adding anything after the trailing slash, they will send a request to "/". This time, have your root route display a template with a message welcoming users to your portfolio.

Projects
If a user adds /projects to your website's url (in this case localhost:5000, display an HTML page with a list of the projects you've done.

About 
If a user sends a request to /about display a template with a short paragraph about yourself.
