Assignment: Dojo Survey
Build a flask application that accepts a form submission, redirects, and presents the submitted data on a results page.

The goal is to help you get familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. Consider the below example as a guide.



Hint: Although we've told you never to render from a post route, you'll need to do so for this assignment. We'll show you tools to avoid doing so soon.
