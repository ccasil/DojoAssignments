About Python
Break down the image below into proper HTML and CSS. Feel free to download the assignment here: Python

Before you submit your work:

Remember that you're here to learn: Don't try to find the original source code of these images.
Use images here for this exercise.
Make sure you've validated your HTML and that you're not using any float: left or right.
For the ">>" on the list, don't worry about making it look exactly like >> but you can just have a normal circle appear for your assignment.
Do NOT make this responsive.  Just make this work for a fixed width (set the width to be 970px).  If you have time during the bootcamp, you can go through our responsive design course later. For now, try to master the CSS principles for fixed width first.
