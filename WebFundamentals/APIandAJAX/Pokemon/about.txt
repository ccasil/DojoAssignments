Assignment: What's that Pokemon? Build Your Own Pokedex

How do you know which Pokemon was clicked? Maybe we can give each Pokemon a unique id that corresponds with their number in the URL?
<img id="2" src="http://pokeapi.co/media/img/2.png">
So that when the image is clicked, we get its id and add it to the end of this URL: "http://pokeapi.co/api/v1/pokemon/" then we make the ajax request with that URL that we constructed.
