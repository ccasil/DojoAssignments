Fake Blog
Create a fake blog using only HTML. Your blog can be about anything! Your hobbies, your favorite sports team/player, your favorite tv show, etc. Your blog can look however you want it to look, but your document should use the following tags at the least:

HTML
head, title, meta description, 
body, div, a, p, h1, ul, li, table (including thead, td, tbody, tr)
At the bottom of the page, create a fake survey form that uses the following tags:
form, select, input type="text", input type="checkbox", input type="radio", input type="submit".
You can use one of the Lorem Ipsum generators for dummy text. Here is an example of how you may want your blog to look:
