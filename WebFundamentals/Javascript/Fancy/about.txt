Fancy Array
Normally, if you print an array such as ["James", "Jill", "Jane", "Jack"], you will see the following:

[ "James", "Jill", "Jane", "Jack" ]
Let's make it look fancy! Write a function that will make it print like:

0 -> James
1 -> Jill
2 -> Jane
3 -> Jack
Bonus (Only If You Have Time):

Let the user pass in the symbol that will print (ex: "->", "=>", "::", "-----")
Have an extra parameter reversed. If the user passes true, print the elements in reverse order
