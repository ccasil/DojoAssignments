Random Chance
Let's play the slots!

Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).

There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 quarters -- use Math.random and Math.floor to pick a random number of coins).

While the user still has quarters, use Math.random to determine if they won.

If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).

Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted.

Bonus (Only If You Have Time):

Let the user pass the number they are willing to leave
(ex: If they won the lottery and still have 40 coins, they will keep playing until they have collected 200 coins)
