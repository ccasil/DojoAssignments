Assignment: jQuery Functions
Create a web page that uses the following jQuery functions: Don't randomly start writing jQuery and find elements to attach jQuery code to. Think about what each function could be useful for! This is an assignment that previous students have often reverted back to so as to brush up on their jQuery in later weeks! Use the mockup as motivation, but feel free to embellish!

Important: Sometimes students spend too much time going through the documentation that it prevents them from actually building things. Skim through the documentation quickly and casually play around to get familiar with only the following jQuery methods. Once you have spent 4-5 hours on this assignment, move on as you'll get to learn more about how you can use these jQuery methods to build some amazing things later on.  The wireframe on the right shows only 3 functions being tested.  In this assignment, we want you to add more and test all 18 jQuery functions shown below.
